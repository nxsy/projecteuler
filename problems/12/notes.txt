The nth triangle number is n(n+1)/2.

The number of factors of m*n is the function of the factors of m and n, with an
upper bound of the product of the number of factors of m and n when m and n do
not share any factors.

n and n+1 will not have any common factors (other than 1), since common factors
would require that the two numbers be separated by that number.  Since they
have no common factors, the total number of factors is the product of the
number of factors of each.

The division by 2 in the nth triangle number means that 1 (if the number if a
power of two) or 2 factors are removed from n or n+1, whichever is prime.

The number of factors of a number can be determined by the number of unique
prime factors of the number and the powers to which these prime factors are
raised in the prime factor product:

    50 = (2**1) * (5**2)

The number of divisors of a number is the product of the powers of the prime
factors, each increased by one.  Each factor is the product of none, some, or
all of the powers of each prime factor.  For the above case, we can choose the
following combinations:

	factor		power of 2	power of 5	product
	1		0		0		(2**0) * (5**0)
	5		0		1		(2**0) * (5**1)
	25		0		2		(2**0) * (5**2)
	2		1		0		(2**1) * (5**0)
	10		1		1		(2**1) * (5**1)
	50		1		2		(2**1) * (5**2)

numdivisors((a**m) * (b**n) * ...) = (m+1) * (n+1) * ...
numdivisors((2**1) * (5**2)) = 2 * 3 = 6
